# Transfer Learning - Image Embeddings Generator

Transfer Learning - Image Embeddings Generator is a simple script that takes advantage of pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) on ImageNet to generate a significant feature representation of an input image. 

### Motivation

When dealing with images, no matter how simple the project is, their naive vector representation (width * height * channels) can take an order of magnitude of tens of thousands of features, each! And despite the required memory space, are all the pixels in an image relevant for a classification task? - No!

Transfer Learning for images, more specific Transferring Knowledge of Feature Representations, takes an image and do a forward pass in a CNN trained on another domain for a different task, and returns a low-dimensional representation of the given image. This new representation is expected to be a more significant and smaller vector of the input given that is the result of applying a sequence of pre-learned kernels.

The main goal of this repository is to provide different image embeddings for a quick evaluation of machine learning algorithms trained on different representations of the input data.
